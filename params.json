[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Foscari)\r\n2. [Main-Page](http://www.lamalcontenta.com/) \r\n\r\n### Hierarchical decomposition of the model\r\nDuring to approach to the creation of three-dimensional model, we chose to hierarchically decompose the structure of the villa into five-plus-one parts:\r\n* **The Twin Stairs and the Colonnade-Basement**\r\n* **The Main Building**\r\n* **The Colonnade** _(better, A column)_\r\n* **The Main Roof and the Roof upon the Colonnade**\r\n* **The Back-Side of the Villa**\r\n* **All the other stuff** _(such as windows, banisters, gratings...)_\r\n\r\n### Twin Stairs and Colonnade-Basement\r\n\r\nDue its symmetrical nature, Villa Foscari can be split in a right-half and a left-half.\r\n\r\nLet's concentrate on the last one, because we'll obtain the other half simply with a `S` trasformation.\r\nMoreover Rotational trasformations, `R`, are used to create the upper side of the stairs and due its squareness, we'll use mostly `CUBOID` functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n![The Twin Stairs](http://s18.postimage.org/dzyvu1q53/Schermata_07_2456127_alle_19_27_24.png)\r\nThe same trick can be used to draw the Colonnade_Basement, which is exactly between the twin stairs.\r\n![Colonnade_Basement](http://s15.postimage.org/5j9xwt7bd/Schermata_07_2456127_alle_19_38_11.png)\r\n\r\nHere you can see the final result, combining the stairs and the basement.\r\n![Result](http://s16.postimage.org/suueyi40z/Schermata_07_2456127_alle_19_40_57.png)\r\n\r\n### Main Building\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Colonnade\r\nThe colonnade is the most complex part of the project as it was decided to model the capital as an Archimedean spiral drawn by a NUBS (Archimedean spiral). It was also used a light-domain to avoid overloading the global model.\r\n\r\nTo draw the column instead, we chose to adopt divide-and-conquer-approach:\r\n* _Column-Base_ with `NUBS` and `ROTATIONAL SURFACE`.\r\n* _Column-Shaft_ with a `CYLINDER_SURFACE`\r\n* _Column-Capital_ still with `NUBS` `ROTATIONAL SURFACE` and `BEZIER`\r\n\r\n### The Main Roof and the Roof upon the Colonnade\r\n### The Back_Side of the Villa\r\n### All the other stuff\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
